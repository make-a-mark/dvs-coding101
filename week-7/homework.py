#In this assignment you will need to make 1 Functions please read each description carefully.

# Function Number 1:
# make a function that will take in a single parameter (to which a int should be passed in). Loop from 1 to a. It should only print out the even numbers. In addition if a number <= 0 is passed in printout "Invalid number", else run the other logic. 
#Hint: the operator modulo will be useful. Also this will require a nested if statement in the while loop.
def looping(a):
  i = 1 #think of i as a counter
  #fill out the condition in the if look at the description
  if():
    
  else:
    #what condition do you need: <, >, <=, or >=
    while(i  a)
      #fill the rest referencing the description above.
